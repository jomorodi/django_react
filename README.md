# Introduction

This tutorial will walk through the process of implementing user authentication between a Django backend and a React frontend using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with the help of [jwt.io](https://jwt.io). We'll start by setting up a basic Django backend with a user authentication system, then create a React frontend and integrate it with our backend. Finally, we'll implement JWT-based authentication to secure our web application, and access protected data. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use JWT to implement user authentication in a full-stack web application. For more discussion on why or why not to use JWT visit [here](https://blog.logrocket.com/jwt-authentication-best-practices/).

## What is JWT?

JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. In the context of web applications, JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes.

JWTs are useful because they allow a user to authenticate once and then securely transmit that authentication information between different parts of an application. This can eliminate the need to constantly re-authenticate a user, which can improve the overall user experience. JWTs are also stateless, which means that no server-side state needs to be stored, making them a good fit for distributed applications.

Django Rest Framework's built-in JWT functionality provides an easy way to use JWTs for authentication and authorization. When a user logs in, a JSON web token is generated by the server and sent to the client. The client then includes the token in subsequent requests to the server to prove that it has already been authenticated.

When a request with a JWT is received by the server, the server validates the token by checking its signature and decoding the payload. If the token is valid, the server uses the information in the payload to authorize the request. If the token is not valid, the request is denied.

Security is a critical aspect of using JWT for authentication and authorization. JWT tokens can potentially be intercepted and used by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or actions. It's important to properly secure tokens to prevent this. The tokens should be sent over HTTPS, and they should be properly validated to ensure they haven't been tampered with. It's also important to set a short expiration time for the access token to minimize the risk of an attacker using it. Django Rest Framework's JWT implementation includes measures to mitigate these risks, but it's still important to follow best practices to ensure the security of your application.
